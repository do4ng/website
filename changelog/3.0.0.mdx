## âœ¨ 3.0.0 is here!

After two months of development, 3.0 has finally been released!

<Box type="tip">
  If you want to move from 2.0 to 3.0, please refer to the [Migration Guide](/docs/migration-2x#migration).

</Box>

### Start 3.0

You can easily download the template by entering the command below.

```bash
npx zely-cli init --dir=app --template=typescript
```

<Box type="info">
  `npm:zely` is a re-exported package of the `@zely-js/zely` and `zely-cli` packages.  
  You can get the same result whether you import `zely` or `@zely-js/zely` (excluding CLI).

</Box>

The changes are as follows:

- [context](/docs/context)
- [loader](/plugins/create-loader)
- `middleware()`

You can add middleware that only works on that page.

```ts
export default [
  middleware((ctx) => {
    /**/
  }),
];
```

- [virtual pages](/apis/virtual-page)
