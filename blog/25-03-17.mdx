In v4, everything has changed internally.

## Performance

With version `4.0.0-next.16`, performance has improved approximately 6 times compared to previous versions, allowing it to handle three times more requests.

[Performance Benchmark](https://github.com/zely-js/benchmark-history)

> Note: There was a significant performance drop when updating from 2.0 to 3.0, but this issue has been resolved with the 4.0 update, making it even faster. (Excluding 1.0)

The difference in performance between `serpack` enabled and disabled is probably due to cold start.

## New Compiler

In the existing zely, esbuild was used as the default loader.  
Although esbuild is still the default loader, I introduced a new loader called [serpack](/serpack) based on swc.  
It will increase the expandability of zely in the future.

```bash
npx zely dev --serpack
```

Serpack is less performant than esbuild (but it still fast!), it has the advantage of being optimized for zely.

<Box type="warning">
  This compiler is under development. The sourcemap and circular dependency issues are
  still not resolved.
</Box>

## Build Server

Server build feature added!  
You can bundle multiple typescript pages into **one JavaScript File**.

> [auto importing](/docs/auto) feature isn't supported.

> Refer: [Build Server](/apis/build-server)

## CLI Request Tool

No more writing code during server development,
such as creating separate JavaScript files to check if it works properly.

```ansi
$ zely request

â–¸ baseURL: [1m[32mhttp://localhost:3001[39m[22m

[90m[12:31:35 AM][39m [1m[34minfo[39m[22m [1mchecking server... (requesting /)[22m

[1m[34mGET[39m[22m> /
[32m200[39m {"msg":"Hello","name":""}
[1m[34mGET[39m[22m>
```

Set header or method using JavaScript code in input prompt.

```ansi
[1m[34mGET[39m[22m> config1 = { method: "POST", headers: { }, body: { name: "Cat" } }
[1m[34mGET[39m[22m> set(config1)
[1m[34mPOST[39m[22m[90m(config1)[39m> /greeting
[32m200[39m Hello, Cat!
```

<Box type="tip">
  Declare variables without declaration statements such as `const` or `let`.
</Box>
## HTML Support

The new HTML loader goes through a compilation step instead of just passing the original HTML file,
which increases responsiveness. - [learn more](/docs/frontend)

To use HTML loader, enable `experimental.useHTML`.

```ts [title="zely.config.ts"]
import { defineConfig } from 'zely';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    useHTML: true,
  },
});
```
