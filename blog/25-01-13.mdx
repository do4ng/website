> Introducing the New Compiler - [serpack](https://github.com/do4ng/serpack)

## Motivation

Currently, loaders using esbuild are very difficult to scale as I want.
Although it can be implemented by putting the desired function into the code output by esbuild, there are minor problems such as low efficiency.

That's why I developed a compiler to replace the existing loader with [serpack](https://github.com/do4ng/serpack) loader. New compiler is easy to scale and can be changed to my taste.

## Comparison

Below is a comparison between the serpack loader and the esbuild loader.

### Performance

compile performance - https://github.com/zely-js/zely/blob/zely4/playground/typescript/pages/index.ts

- esbuild-loader: `7.24ms`
- serpack-loader: `6.19ms`

serpack loader is approximately 10% faster than esbuild loader.

```bash
 yarn workspace @playground/typescript dev --loader-performance
```

<Box>
  serpack uses [swc](https://swc.rs/) instead of [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
</Box>

### Error tracking

The serpack loader does not yet support error tracking.

### Stability

Serpack is not finished yet and there are many bugs.

## Getting Started

<Tabs>
<TabItem id="zely.config.ts">

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'zely';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    useSerpack: true,
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem id="zely.config.js">

```js
const { defineConfig } = require('zely');

module.exports = defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    useSerpack: true,
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Just enable `experimental.useSerpack`!

## Conclusion

The serpack is **not ready to be used as a production** yet.  
However, some of the features will be developed based on the serverpack, and the end goal is to replace the esbuild loader
