It has been seven months since `4.0.0-next.0` was released.
This new version brings both **feature updates** and **major internal performance improvements**.
Hereâ€™s a summary of everything that has changed.

## Performance

In line with zely's philosophy, performance has been **dramatically improved**.

Compared to previous versions, the latest update significantly reduces latency and nearly triples throughput (requests/sec and bytes/sec).
This level of performance leap is not just a minor improvementâ€”it redefines how lightweight servers can operate at scale.

> Even when [serpack](#new-compiler) is enabled, there is **no noticeable performance loss**, proving that the new compiler is lightweight enough for production environments.

## New Compiler

zely now supports a new compiler to allow for more flexibility in future updates.
Although `esbuild` remains the default loader, zely introduces [serpack](/serpack), a custom loader built on top of `swc`.

```bash
zely dev --serpack
```

While serpack is slightly less performant than `esbuild` (but still fast!), it is **tightly optimized for zely**'s internal systems and unlocks powerful features not available with esbuild.

<Box type="warning">
  Although serpack is mostly stable, undiscovered issues may still occur.
</Box>

## Server Build

You can now **compile and deploy** your zely-powered server as JavaScript.

The old version of build feature (provided by [@zely/builder](https://zely2.netlify.app/docs/zely-builder#usage)) became incompatible after 3.0 due to internal changes, but the feature is now back in 4.0â€”completely rebuilt.

While the original builder only copied and transpiled the server, the new build system routes all requests directly through the zely server runtime.

For details, refer to the [build documentation](/apis/build).

## \$store

[`$store`](/docs/server-data) is a server-side cache utility.

It runs the given callback function **only once**, caches the result, and reuses it for 3 minutes.

```ts
import { GET } from '@zely-js/core';
import { setTimeout } from 'timers/promises';

async function greeting() {
  await setTimeout(1000);
  return 'Hello, Doe!';
}

export default [
  GET(async (ctx) => {
    const { data } = await $store(greeting);
    ctx.send(data);
  }),
];
```

`$store` is already globally declared, so you **donâ€™t need to import it manually**.

<Box type="warning">
  Since $store internally depends on features provided by [serpack](/serpack), please
  activate it using the `--serpack` flag when running your server.
</Box>

## Frontend Support (Experimental)

> Note: This is an experimental feature for upcoming frontend support.

The new HTML loader compiles the HTML file instead of directly serving it, improving responsiveness and enabling future extensibility.
[Learn more](/docs/frontend)

Enable the loader with `experimental.useHTML` in `zely.config.ts`:

```ts [title="zely.config.ts"]
import { defineConfig } from 'zely';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    useHTML: true,
  },
});
```

## CLI Request Tool

No need to write temporary scripts to test your server during development.

```ansi
$ zely request

â–¸ baseURL: [1m[32mhttp://localhost:3001[39m[22m

[90m[12:31:35 AM][39m [1m[34minfo[39m[22m [1mchecking server... (requesting /)[22m

[1m[34mGET[39m[22m> /
[32m200[39m {"msg":"Hello","name":""}
[1m[34mGET[39m[22m>
```

You can also use JavaScript to configure method, headers, and body inline:

```ansi
[1m[34mGET[39m[22m> config1 = { method: "POST", headers: { }, body: { name: "Cat" } }
[1m[34mGET[39m[22m> set(config1)
[1m[34mPOST[39m[22m[90m(config1)[39m> /greeting
[32m200[39m Hello, Cat!
```

<Box type="tip">
  Declare variables without using `const` or `let`â€”just type them directly in the prompt.
</Box>

## Debugging

Check the [debugging documentation](/docs/debugging) for more details.

## Conclusion

This release makes zely faster, more modular, and ready for future features like frontend rendering and build-time optimizations.
With the introduction of serpack, a new compiler architecture, and the return of server builds, zely is growing beyond just a micro-frameworkâ€”itâ€™s evolving into a complete platform for building fast, modern web applications.

Give it a try and let us know what you think.
