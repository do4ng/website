I decided to develop 4.0 to reenergize zely's development.

zely(v3) has focused too much on the backend, but it failed to achieve the goal of creating the fastest backend framework.  
So after 3.0 was completed, Zely was left for a few months.

Now, I'm going to develop 4.0 to rekindle my interest in developing as a side project

## Plan

> see also [https://github.com/zely-js/zely/issues/405](https://github.com/zely-js/zely/issues/405)

### improve export-default

```ts
export default { message: 'Hello' };
```

As above, there is a code that exports data by default without setting a handler

This code will work just like the code below.

```ts
export default [ALL((ctx) => ctx.send({ message: 'Hello' }))];
```

At first glance, the code has improved readability, and it's much simpler

### improve performance

The goal of creating the fastest backend framework has not been abandoned yet.  
I will continue to improve the performance of zely.

### support .html

Not long ago, I made [a package](https://segify.vercel.app) as a side project.  
I will utilize this project and update zely to make it easier to create a frontend page using the `.html` extension

> Note: This will only work if you enable the option separately. Normally, it will just send html through `sendFile`.

### integrating multiple packages

Currently, Zely is divided into several packages. Questions arise as to whether this division is necessary

> when zely app created via `npx zely-cli init` and packages downloaded

### createFrontendPage

`createFrontendPage` is a function that will be used for all the functions related to the frontend mentioned earlier
