zely3 rewrote the code to increase development efficiency. The code actually has improved a bit, but the performance became ridiculously bad.

In zely4, we will focus on performance and add back features that were lost while rewriting the code.

## Plan

> see also [https://github.com/zely-js/zely/issues/405](https://github.com/zely-js/zely/issues/405)

### improve export-default

```ts
export default { message: 'Hello' };
```

As above, there is a code that exports data by default without setting a handler

This code will work just like the code below.

```ts
export default [ALL((ctx) => ctx.send({ message: 'Hello' }))];
```

At first glance, the code has improved readability, and it's much simpler

### improve performance

The goal of creating the fastest backend framework has not been abandoned yet.  
I will continue to improve the performance of zely.

<Box type="tip">
  zely4 can handle about **2.68x more requests** and is **11x faster** than zely3 -

### support .html

Not long ago, I made [a package](https://segify.vercel.app) as a side project.  
I will utilize this project and update zely to make it easier to create a frontend page using the `.html` extension

> Note: This will only work if you enable the option separately. Normally, it will just send html through `sendFile`.

### integrating multiple packages

Currently, Zely is divided into several packages. Questions arise as to whether this division is necessary

### createFrontendPage

`createFrontendPage` is a function that will be used for all the functions related to the frontend mentioned earlier
