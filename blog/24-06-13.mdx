## Introduction of Rust

I am currently considering adopting [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The [base http module](https://github.com/zely-js/zely/tree/zely3/http) of zely-js will be written with [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  
This will help improve the performance of zely.

## Improve Watcher

I am currently planning to develop a separate watch module.  
This watcher will be developed in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and will serve to compile TypeScript projects through [swc](https://swc.rs/).

This watcher will be applied to the zely and will have a significant impact on development performance.

## To Middleware

You will be able to export the virtual page and use it with other frameworks.

```js
const { createVirtualPage: virtual } = require('@zely-js/zely');

const middleware = virtual('main.ts', []).export();
```
