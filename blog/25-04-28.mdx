In previous versions of Zely, there wasn't a dedicated feature for static server data.  
The [staticProps](https://zely.netlify.app/blog/2023-11-05#static-props) feature that briefly appeared in Zely 1.0 disappeared as we moved toward Zely 2.0.  
Now, static props caching is back â€” more powerful and updated than ever.

Starting from this version, caching happens automatically just by writing an asynchronous function.  
From the second request onward, the cached data will be used instead of fetching it again!

## Example

Let's walk through an example.

```ts
import { GET } from '@zely-js/core';
import { setTimeout } from 'timers/promises';

async function greeting(name: string) {
  await setTimeout(1000);
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

export default [
  GET(async (ctx) => {
    const message = await greeting(ctx.params.name);
    ctx.send(message);
  }),
];
```

In this rather extreme example, imagine that fetching some data takes about one second due to its size.  
If this data is static, repeatedly fetching it for every request would be highly inefficient.

To solve this problem, we could manually create and store a variable, like this:

```ts
let message = {};

async function greeting(name: string) {
  if (message[name]) return message[name];

  await setTimeout(1000);

  message[name] = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  return message[name];
}

export default [
  GET(async (ctx) => {
    const message = await greeting(ctx.params.name);
    ctx.send(message);
  }),
];
```

Saving and managing data for each different parameter becomes much more complicated.

## The Solution

In Zely 4.0, this entire process is greatly simplified.

You just need to follow two rules:

1. The function must be asynchronous.
2. The function name must start with a `$`.

> Rule 2 is a temporary solution to prevent excessive caching. It can be modified to a better rule at any time.

Here's how the previous example can be updated:

```ts
async function $greeting(name: string) {
  await setTimeout(1000);
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

export default [
  GET(async (ctx) => {
    const message = await $greeting(ctx.params.name);
    ctx.send(message);
  }),
];
```

That's it.

By simply renaming the function with a `$` prefix, [serpack](/serpack) will automatically transform the code to cache the result for each parameter separately.  
Each cached entry will expire after 6 minutes.

## Try It Out

This feature is still under active testing, and it may not yet behave perfectly in every situation.  
For now, it is provided as a plugin.

You can enable it like this:

```ts
// .serpackrc.ts
import { optimizer } from '@zely-js/optimizer';

export default <import('serpack').Options>{
  compilerOptions: {
    plugins: [optimizer()],
  },
};
```

<Box type="info">
  This plugin is intended exclusively for the Serpack compiler. To use this feature, make
  sure to enable the `--serpack` flag.
