zely 3.0 is currently under development.  
There is still a long way to go, but I will record the development status.

If you want to check your contribution or development status, check out [Github](https://github.com/zely-js/zely)

## Getting Started

See [Getting-Started Guide](/docs/getting-started).

## Code Rewrite

The zely code has been rewritten from scratch.  
As it was rewritten, many features were added and improved,
but some features were deprecated due to optimization or other reasons.

## Features

Here are the major changes:

### Context

Now both the `export-default` and `export` handlers receive [context](/docs/context) as an argument instead of `req` and `res`.

### Loader

You can now configure the loader yourself.

In the existing v2, files other than `.js` and `.ts` could be compiled with the plugin,
but by setting the loader, all files including `.ts` and `.js` can be compiled with the desired loader.

### Virtual Page

See [virtual page documentation](/apis/virtual-page).
