The zely is based on the [osik](/apis/osik) aimed at light weight and speed.
Reading the [osik documentation](/apis/osik) will help you understand.

## Middleware Usage

Middleware in Zely is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
Here's an example of a middleware function:

```ts [title="middlewares/message.ts"]
import { Middleware } from 'zely';

export const Message: Middleware = (req, res, next) => {
  (req as any).message = 'Hello World!';
  next();
};
```

```ts [title="pages/index.ts"]
import { ZelyRequest, ZelyResponse } from 'zely';

export function get(req: ZelyRequest, res: ZelyResponse) {
  res.end((req as any).message);
}
```

This middleware function, named Message, adds a property message to the request object and assigns it the value 'Hello World!'. The next() function call is used to pass control to the next middleware function.

### Middleware Registration

To use the middleware, you need to add it to the config.middlewares array in your Zely configuration file:

```ts [title="zely.config.ts"]
import { Message } from './middlewares/message';

export default defineConfig({
  middlewares: [Message],
  // ...
});
```

## Auto Mode

Auto Mode is a feature provided by Zely to automatically load and apply all middleware files in a specified directory.
This feature is designed to save developers from the tedious task of manually adding each middleware to the configuration.

To enable Auto Mode, you need to set the `allowAutoMiddlewares` configuration value to `true`.
This tells Zely to automatically load middleware from a specified directory.

```ts [title="zely.config.ts"]
export default defineConfig({
  allowAutoMiddlewares: true,
  middlewareDirectory: 'middlewares',
  // relative path to the middleware directory
  // ...
});
```

In this example, Zely will load all middleware from the `middlewares` directory at the root of your project.

One important thing to note is that when using Auto Mode, your middleware should be exported as the default export.
This is because Zely will use the default export from each file in the middleware directory as a middleware function.

```ts [title="middlewares/message.ts"]
import { Middleware } from 'zely';

const Message: Middleware = (req, res, next) => {
  (req as any).message = 'Hello World!';

  next();
};

// export as default

export default Message;
```

While Auto Mode can save time and effort,
it's important to be aware that it may also load unnecessary files if they are placed in the middleware directory.
This could potentially cause performance issues.
Therefore, it's recommended to only place middleware files in the middleware directory when using Auto Mode.

> Note: [`@zely/builder`](/docs/zely-builder) doesn't support auto mode.
