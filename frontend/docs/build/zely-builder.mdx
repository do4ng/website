> warning: `@zely/builder` is a experimental package.

## When should I use it?

Apps compiled with @zely/builder only work in esm environment (`{"type": "module"}`).  
On the other hand, apps built with zely only work in commonjs environment.

To run it in a cjs environment, use zely, and to run it in an esm environment, use @zely/builder. (but @zely/builder recommended)

## Usage

```js
const builder = require('@zely/builder');
const build = new builder.Builder({
  esbuild: {}, // esbuild options
  zely: {}, // zely options
  output: 'dist', // output directory
});

build.process(); // build app
```

Just run the code above and run `dist/main.js`.

```bash
node dist/main.js
```
