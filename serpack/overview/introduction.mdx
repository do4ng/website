> [Introduction of serpack](/blog/25-01-13)

_Serpack is a TypeScript/JavaScript compiler for application development, powered by swc._

This compiler is optimized for high-speed bundling and execution of TypeScript files, leveraging [swc](https://swc.rs/) as a transformer and [oxc](https://oxc.rs/) as a resolver for enhanced performance.

By default, serpack is built to run Javascript/Typescript, but it also supports module bundling.

```bash
npx serpack ./src/awesome-app.ts # run script
```

<Box type="error">It's not ready to be used for production yet</Box>

## Why?

[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) is an excellent bundler, but Zely is a framework with its own unique requirements and ecosystem.  
Therefore, developing a custom bundler, serpack, tailored specifically for Zely, offers better technical independence, optimized performance, and a more seamless developer experience

## How Does It Work?

The core mechanism of serpack is straightforward. When serpack compiles a TypeScript or JavaScript file, it first uses [SWC](https://swc.rs) to transform all files into JavaScript. Then, it analyzes the compiled output to apply features like plugins and [modifiers](/serpack/modifier).
Finally, it bundles multiple files into a single output using Serpack's built-in bundling system. That's all.

## Getting Started

---

1. try serpack on zely

<Tabs>
<TabItem id="CLI">
```bash
npx zely dev --serpack # or npx zely-cli dev --serpack
```

> Enable `--serpack` flag

</TabItem>
<TabItem id="zely.config.ts">

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'zely';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    useSerpack: true,
  },
});
```

> Enable `experimental.useSerpack` option

</TabItem>
<TabItem id="zely.config.js">

```js
const { defineConfig } = require('zely');

module.exports = defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    useSerpack: true,
  },
});
```

> Enable `experimental.useSerpack` option

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

2. try serpack on your project

```bash
npm i --save-dev serpack
```
