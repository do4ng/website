Including dependencies in a bundle not only increases capacity, but also increases compilation time.  
Serpack provides `'external'` option that excludes `node_modules` from bundle results to resolve this issue.

## In CLI

```bash
npx serpack ./index.ts --external
```

Enable `--external` flag to exclude node_modules from bundle.

## In JavaScript

### Exclude specific dependencies

```ts
compile('src/index.ts', {
  externals: ['lodash', 'axios'],
});
```

### Exclude ALL node_modules

```ts
compile('src/index.ts', {
  nodeExternal: true, // default: false
});
```

### Force External

The [`externals`](#exclude-specific-dependencies) works by finding the dependency's `package.json` through the resolver and excluding it if it matches the `name` field of `package.json`.

To skip this process and directly compare the path in `import` or `require` statements (e.g., `require("my-pkg") => my-pkg`) without using the resolver,
use the force external option.

```ts
compile('src/index.ts', {
  forceExternal: ['my-workspace'],
});
```

This can contribute to a slight performance improvement.
