serpack is a compiler built specifically to enhance the developer experience of zelyjs.

## What are serpack-only features?

Serpack supports low-level AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) modifications, and zely actively utilizes this capability.
This means that zely may not function correctly when using alternative loaders such as **esbuild** (which is the default loader provided by zely).

To enable serpack-only features, use the `--serpack` flag or enable the serpack option in your configuration file. - [How to enable serpack](/serpack/introduction#getting-started)

## Do I need to enable serpack?

Not necessarily. serpack is still under development and may contain unverified or unstable bugs.
**If you prioritize stability, you are not required to use serpack.**

However, as mentioned earlier, zely is already leveraging low-level AST manipulation through serpack.
Therefore, some features in zely that rely on serpack will not be available unless serpack is enabled.

## Conclusion

All advanced and upcoming features of zely are built with serpack in mind.
While we don't recommend serpack for production use just yet, if you want to unlock the full potential of zely, we recommend enabling serpack.
