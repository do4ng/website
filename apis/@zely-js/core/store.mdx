Store is a feature that stores frequently used data for 3 minutes and reuses it.

<Box type="tip">
  To use this feature, refer to the [Server Data Guide](/docs/server-data).

## \$store

`$store` takes a function as its first argument and an array of dependencies as its second argument.
When `$store` is executed, it generates a unique ID based on the code location and dependencies. If cached data exists for that ID, it uses the cached data; otherwise, it executes the function and stores the result in the cache.

```ts
const { data, id } = $store(fn, [someDep]);
```

<Box type="warning">
  To ensure the compiler can extract the `$store` function properly during compilation, do
  not import `$store` under a different name. By default, it is globally imported, so
  there's usually no need to import it manually. However, if you do need to import it, use
  the original `$store` name.
</Box>

## \$access

You can access the cached data externally using the `id` returned from `$store`.

```ts
const { value, set, refresh } = $access(id);
```

## \$cache

You can access the cache class directly.

```ts
$cache.ttl = 1000 * 60 * 6; // cache ttl: 6m
```
