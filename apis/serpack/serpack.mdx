Serpack is optimized for high-speed bundling and execution of TypeScript files, leveraging [swc](https://swc.rs/) as a transformer and [oxc](https://oxc.rs/) as a resolver for enhanced performance.

By default, serpack is built to run Javascript/Typescript, but it also supports module bundling.

```bash
npx serpack ./src/awesome-app.ts # run script
```
