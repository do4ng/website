zely saves the built typescript file in the `/.zely/` folder.

## .zely/pages.hash.json

`.zely/pages.hash.json` is used to check whether the file has been modified in dev mode.

## .zely/pages

`.zely/pages` is where the built typescript files are stored.  
By default, it is saved with the `.map` file. (used for error tracking)
