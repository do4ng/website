Zely is a lightweight backend framework for Node.js that prioritizes speed, simplicity, and modern development practices.

## Features

1. **File based Routing**

Automatically generate routes based on file structure.

2. **Server Restarting**

No need to restart your server to apply changes.

3. **TypeScript Supported**

Fully supports TypeScript.

4. **Blazing Fast**

Built on [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) (optionally [swc](https://swc.rs)) for unparalleled speed and efficiency.

## Introduction

Zely is a minimalist Node.js backend framework influenced by Next.js.
It aims to streamline backend development while being the fastest and lightest solution available.

Under the hood, Zely uses [own engine](https://github.com/zely-js/senta) for its lightweight and high-performance server capabilities,
and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) to optimize compile times and runtime efficiency.

## Why Zely?

### Challenges

1. **Development Bottlenecks**

Setting up a simple server in TypeScript involves multiple steps:  
installing dependencies, writing code, compiling `.ts` files to `.js`, and then running the server.

This process is time-consuming and inefficient.

2. **Cumbersome Routing**

Managing routes in traditional frameworks becomes increasingly complex as the number of endpoints grows (e.g., `/post/*`, `/user/*`).

### Solution

1. **Simplified Workflow**

Zely removes the hassle of manual setup by integrating everything into a single framework.

2. **Optimized Routing**

With file-based routing, Zely minimizes the need for explicit configuration.

3. **Unpredicable Speed**

Zely ensures your development experience is fast.
