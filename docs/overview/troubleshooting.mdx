## Error: listen EADDRINUSE

The port is already in use. Please choose a different [port](/apis/config#server.port).

## Production build is only available in production mode.

This occurs when you try to run the server in production mode, but `process.env.NODE_ENV` is not `production`.

## $store is not defined

[$store](/docs/server-data) is a feature that uses the serpack compiler, so if you don't use the serpack compiler, this feature won't work properly.

```diff {4}
{
  "scripts": {
-   "dev": "zely dev",
+   "dev": "zely dev --serpack",
  }
}
```

## A crash occurred while applying the optimization plugin.

This error occurred due to a conflict with another plugin while applying [@zely-js/core:store](https://github.com/zely-js/zely/blob/main/packages/zely-js-core/src/runtime/store/compiler.ts).

Try one of the following actions:

- Remove the plugin that is expected to conflict.
- Disable the [serpack](/serpack) compiler
  and remove the code that uses [$store](/docs/server-data).

## Error occurred while compiling server-side rendered HTML.

This error occurs when server-side rendering fails when compiling HTML.
