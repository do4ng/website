You can serve your asset directory by using the plugin provided by zely.

## Before You Start

Install the plugin:

```bash
npm i @zely-js/static
```

> Don't have a zely app yet? [Create one](/docs/getting-started)!

## Usage

```ts
import { staticPlugin } from '@zely-js/static';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [staticPlugin('/static', './public')],
});
```

This will serve all files inside the `./public` directory under the `/static` URL prefix.

For example, if you have a file `./public/logo.png`, it will be available at:

```
http://localhost:PORT/static/logo.png
```

> Make sure to always specify a `prefix` (like `/static`) for performance reasons.
> Directory access is blocked by default (returns 403), and missing files return 404.
