  [This feature is supported by serpack.](/serpack/serpack-only)
</Box>

A feature has been added to execute functions that take a long time to compute or degrade performance only on the first request and then send stored cache data.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem id="With $store">
    > You can see that after the first request, all responses are printed immediately.

    <video src="/assets/cmd-optimized.mp4" width="100%" height="100%" controls></video>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem id="Without $store">
    > You can see that it sends a response after 1 second for every response.

    <video src="/assets/cmd-dev.mp4" width="100%" height="100%" controls></video>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```ts
import { GET } from "@zely-js/core";
import { setTimeout } from "timers/promises";

async function greeting() {
  await setTimeout(1000);
  return "Hello, Doe!";
}

export default [
  GET(async (ctx) => {
    const { data } = await $store(greeting);
    ctx.send(data);
  }),
];
```

<Box type="tip">
  You don't need to import any other modules. Just use the `$store` function
  directly.
</Box>

After the first request, the `$greeting` function will no longer be executed.

<Box type="info">

The code in line 11 will be:

```js
let { data: r } = yield $store(
  $greeting,
  [],
  'pages\\index.ts-586' // unique id
);
e.send(r);
```

</Box>

## Dependencies

To handle dynamically changing dependencies, such as parameters (req.params),
you can register dependencies with the store.

```ts
$store(fn, [someDep]);
```

Data is separated and stored based on the registered dependency value.

<Box type="warning">Each item in dependencies must be of type string.</Box>

## Cache Instance

You can directly access the cache instance through `$cache`.

Since `$cache` is declared globally, you don't need to import it.

<Box type="error" title="Security Warning">
  You can access all cache values declared in the app through `$cache`. Be
  careful not to expose the cache instance.
</Box>

### Instance

```ts
$cache.clearExpired(); // Forcefully deletes expired cache entries. (By default, expired values are removed when setting or retrieving cache)
$cache.get(id); // Retrieves a cached value. The `id` is provided as the return value of $store.
$cache.set(id, value); // Redefines a cached value.
```

### TTL

The store's default TTL (Time To Live) is [6 minutes](https://github.com/zely-js/zely/blob/main/packages/zely-js-core/src/runtime/store/index.ts#L43). To modify the TTL, enter the following code:

```ts
$cache.ttl = 1000 * 60 * 10; // cache ttl: 10m
```

The `$cache` instance is declared globally. You don't need to import it.

## Try this feature

This feature works based on [serpack](/serpack).  
To use this feature, enable the [`--serpack` flag](/serpack/introduction).

```bash
zely dev --serpack
```
