## $access

The safest way to access cache data that has already been declared externally is by using `$access`.

You can access the data using the unique ID returned by `$store`.

```ts
const { id } = await $store(fn);
const cache = $access(id);

console.log(cache.value);

cache.set("Edited"); // The updated value will take effect from the next call.
cache.refresh(); // Resets the time-to-live.
```

<Box type="tip">
  The `$cache` and `$access` are declared globally. You don't need to import
  them.
</Box>

## $cache

You can directly access the cache instance through `$cache`.

Since `$cache` is declared globally, you don't need to import it.

<Box type="error" title="Security Warning">
  You can access all cache values declared in the app through `$cache`. Be
  careful not to expose the cache instance.
</Box>

```ts
$cache.clearExpired(); // Forcefully deletes expired cache entries. (By default, expired values are removed when setting or retrieving cache)
$cache.get(id); // Retrieves a cached value. The `id` is provided as the return value of $store.
$cache.set(id, value); // Redefines a cached value.
```

## TTL

The store's default TTL (Time To Live) is [6 minutes](https://github.com/zely-js/zely/blob/main/packages/zely-js-core/src/runtime/store/index.ts#L43). To modify the TTL, enter the following code:

```ts
$cache.ttl = 1000 * 60 * 10; // cache ttl: 10m
```
